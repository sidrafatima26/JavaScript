  <p> <b> API </b> <br> An API is simply a medium to fetch or send data between interfaces. <br> Let’s say you want to
    make an application that provides the user with some real-time data fetched from the server or maybe even allows you
    to modify or add data to some other endpoint. This is made possible by the API or the Application Programming
    Interface. </p>
  <p><b>Features of Asynchronous code : </b> <br> 1. clean and concise <br> 2. better error handling <br> 3. better
    debugging </p>
  <p><b>Promises</b> <br> The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous
    operation and its resulting value. <br>
    A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate
    handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. This lets asynchronous methods
    return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method
    returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future. <br>
    A Promise is in one of these states: <br>
    pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected. <br>
    fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully. <br>
    rejected: meaning that the operation failed. <br> </p>
  <p> <b>Promise resolve() method: </b> <br> The promise.resolve() method in JS returns a Promise object that is
    resolved with a given value. Any of the three things can happen: <br>
    1. If the value is a promise then the promise is returned. <br>
    2. If the value has a “then” attached to the promise, then the returned promise will follow that “then” to till the
    final state. <br>
    3. The promise fulfilled with its value will be returned. </p>
  <p> <b>The Promise.reject() method </b> <br> is used to return a rejected Promise object with a given reason for
    rejection. It is used for debugging purposes and selective error catching. The catch() method can be used for
    logging the output of the reject() method to the console that is catch() method acts as a career which carries the
    rejected message from Promise.reject() method and displays that in user’s console. </p>
  <p> <b> FETCH API </b> <br> Fetch API fetches the resource from the network and returns a promise that gets fulfilled
    once the response is availble. <br> The output of fetch API is always a Promise. <br>
    Whenever you are using Fetch API you have to send the URL and options. <br> Options is the object which contains
    ket=y value pairs of your secret key.
    <br>Sometimes you have to send a key for authentication like your login credentials, username etc. This becomes your
    secret key through which you can access your particular API.
    <br> So, along with the URL some other data is also sent from your end to the server for you to get access to the
    API. To do this you have to use Request Header
  </p>
  <p> <b> Closures : </b> <br> A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to
    its surrounding state (the lexical environment). <br> In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer
    function's scope from an inner function. <br> In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created,
    at function creation time. <br>
