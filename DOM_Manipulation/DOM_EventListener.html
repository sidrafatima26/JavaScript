    One drawback of writing JS code in the console inside inspect element of a webpage is that on load/ repload/ refresh
    all the code gets executed.<br>
    A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.<br>
    To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute
    EventTarget is a top level interface and has no parent.<br>
    It has 3 methods. Node inherits from EventTarget.<br>
    Node= HTML Characters -> tags -> tokens -> Nodes -> DOM.<br>
    EventTarget is an interface implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them.<br>
    Event hone ke baad jo action hoga vo eventlistener define karga.<br>
    Tere are three methods in EventTarget 1.addEventListener()2.removeEventListener()3.dispatchEvent() class or
    interfaces = Blueprints, Objects= Reality.<br>
    Adding an EventListener() on an EventTarget(): 1.Listen to an Event 2.Respond to Event 3.Hook to Event. <br>
    Window is a global object and EventTarget is an interface.
    Syntax:- <EventTarget>.addEventListener(<Event to Listen for>,<Function to run when Event Happens>).Pehle suno aur
          fir act karo.<br>
          you will need 3 things 1.EventTarget-IOn which component of the HTML docment does the user want to apply
          EventTarget to.<br>
          It can be the whole documnet, a div, a p, a q, a span, an article, a video etc. 2.EventType:- Eg-Click,
          Scroll, Double Click 3.Function- Define what to do when an event happens<br>
          removeEventListener method requires you to pass the same exact listener function to it as the one passed in
          addEventListener.<br>
          Loose equality ==, Strict equality ===.<br>
          In strict equality the value and type must be same but in loose equality only value is same.<br>
          Type Coersion JS will try to convert items compared into same type. === prevents type coersion and == allows
          it.<br>
          Type Coercion refers to the process of automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to
          another. <br>
          This includes conversion from Number to String, String to Number, Boolean to Number etc. when different types
          of operators are applied to the values.<br>
          The target property returns the element where the event occured. <br>
          The target property is read-only.<br>
          The target property returns the element on which the event occurred, opposed to the currentTarget property,
          which returns the element whose event listener triggered the event.

    <p> What is Event propagation? <br> <span> Event propagation, also known as event bubbling and event capturing,
        refers to the order in which events are triggered and processed in the DOM hierarchy. During event bubbling, the
        event is first triggered on the target element and then propagates up the DOM tree to the root element. During
        event capturing, the event is triggered at the root element and then propagates down to the target
        element.</span> </p>
    <p> How to stop Event Propagation? <br> <span> You can stop event propagation in the DOM using the stopPropagation()
        method of the Event object. Calling this method within an event listener prevents the event from propagating
        further up or down the DOM tree. </span> </p>
    <p> What is the this keyword in event handling? <br> <span> In event handling, the this keyword refers to the
        element that triggered the event. It provides a way to access the current HTML element within the event handler
        function. </span> </p>
