# JavaScript
Contains all [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript), ModernJS and DOM Manipulation projects.

## JavaScript First Program
In this project, we've used several important JavaScript topics:

### Array Methods: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, `concat`, `slice`
- **`map`:** The `map` method is used to transform each element in an array and create a new array with the results. In this project, we use `map` to display arithmetic operations.
- **`filter`:** The `filter` method is used to create a new array with all elements that pass a specified test. While not used directly in this project, it's a powerful tool for filtering data in arrays.
- **`reduce`:** The `reduce` method is used to reduce an array to a single value by performing an operation on each element. In this project, we use `reduce` to perform arithmetic operations.
- **`sort`:** The `sort` method is used to sort the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. In this project, we use it to sort numbers generated randomly.
- **`slice`:** The `slice` method is used to extract a portion of an array and returns a new array. In this project, we use `slice` to display a subset of arithmetic operations.
- **`concat`:** The `concat` method is used to merge two or more arrays and returns a new array. In this project, we use `concat` to combine arrays of arithmetic operations.

### Methods: `split` and `join`
- **`split`:** The `split` method is used to split a string into an array of substrings based on a specified delimiter. In this project, we use it to split user input for arithmetic operations.
- **`join`:** The `join` method is used to join all elements of an array into a single string, separated by a specified delimiter. In this project, we use it to display results.

## Sync-Async DOM
Contains Important JavaScript Document Object Model (DOM) features, including synchronous and asynchronous code execution, and the use of `setTimeout`, promises, and promise methods like `resolve`, `reject`, `then`, and `catch` for managing asynchronous operations in your web applications and lastly Closures.
