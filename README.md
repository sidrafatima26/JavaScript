Callback Function:

A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then invoked inside the outer function. It allows asynchronous operations, event handling, and modularization of code.

Closures:

Closures are functions that "close over" variables from their outer (enclosing) scope, preserving access to those variables even after the outer function has finished executing. They provide a way to create private variables and maintain state.

Debouncing:

Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, making them more efficient. In JavaScript, it is often applied to functions that respond to events (like scrolling or resizing). Debouncing prevents the function from being called too frequently, optimizing performance by delaying its execution until after a specific time interval has passed since the last invocation.
