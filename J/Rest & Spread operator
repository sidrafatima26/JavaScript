//The main differnce between rest and spread operator is that rest operator puts rest of the user specified value into a JavaScript array while spread operator expands the iterables into individual elements.
//This is how rest operator works
function restOp(a, b, ...c){
  //"use strict";
 // console.log(typeof(c));
  console.log(a,b,c);
}
restOp("Custard Apple", "Papaya", "Melon", "Grapes", "Strawberry", "Mango");
//This is how spread operator works
function spreadOp(a, b, c){
  console.log(`${a} will ${b} ${c}` );
}
spreadOp(...["Blueberry", "Watermelon", "Fuji Apple"]);

//Things to note:
//1. rest operator will not work in strict mode
//2. The argumnts returned by the rest operator are array like objects not real arrays.

function spreadOp2(){
  let a = ["Apple", "Banana", "Coconut", "Durian", "Elderberry", "Fig", "Guava"];
  let b = ["Hello", ...a, "Bye"];
  console.log(b);
  console.log(typeof(b));
  console.log(typeof(a));
}
spreadOp2();

//Strict Mode inidcates that the code should be executed in strict mode. Strict mode makes it easier to write secure Javascript code. There are certain things you cannot do in strict mode like:
//1. Use an undeclared variable or object
//2. Use delete keyword
//3. Use octal values etc...
