let x=0, y=1, z=0;
if(x==y==z)
  console.log("Enter")

else
  console.log("Exit")

// In this code snippet, you're initializing three variables: x, y, and z, with values 0, 1, and 0 respectively. Then, you're using an if statement to compare if x is equal to y, and if that result is equal to z. Let's break down what happens:

// x == y: This evaluates to false because x is 0 and y is 1.
// false == z: Here, false (which resulted from the previous comparison) is compared to z, which is 0. In JavaScript, false is equal to 0, so this comparison is true.
// So, the condition x == y == z evaluates to true.
